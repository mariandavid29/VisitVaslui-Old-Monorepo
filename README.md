<h1>VisitVaslui - Custom CMS-Based Tourism Platform</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
VisitVaslui - a tourism platform featuring a modern user interface and built using fundamental technologies like vanilla JavaScript, which was a key milestone in my development journey. I am now planning to revive and rebuild this project, incorporating my current knowledge and advanced techniques.

<h2>The platform consists of three sections</h2>

<ul>
<li>Tourist Attractions: An archive of both present and future tourist attractions in the region.</li>
  
<li>Routes: The main feature of the platform, offering three categories of routes based on the preferred mode of transportation â€” by car, by bicycle, or on foot.</li>

<li>Events: A dedicated section providing tourists with up-to-date information about upcoming events.</li>
</ul>
